<p> Assuming, you are on <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2694/~/how-to-determine-the-wii-consoles-menu-version> Wii System Menu 4.3 </a> and using a Wii, not Wii Mini or Wii U, we will guide you thru the setup of <a href="https://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/LetterBomb"> LetterBomb </a>. The first thing you need to do is find your Wii's MAC-Address. This is very simple to do, but if you don't know how to do it, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/includes/rvl-ht-int-find-mac-address.jsp"> here's a guide </a>. Once, you have your Wii's MAC-Address, go on a computer or something with a SD-Card Slot. On that computer, go to <a href="https://please.hackmii.com/"> The LetterBomb Site </a>. With that, file go to your file browser (any OS works) and extract the ZIP file provided from the Letterbomb site. Once, its extracted copy it over to the root of your SD-Card. Before, you put the SD-Card back in your Wii make a new folder called apps (you don't need to put anything in it; we can use it for later uses though. Now, that you have done that, put the SD-Card back inside your Wii and go to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Wii/Usage/Wii-Message-Board/Accessing-the-Message-Board/Accessing-the-Message-Board-240088.html"> Wii Message Board </a> and go back a day or two and you will see a message that is RED and has a BOMB on it. Click it. A scam warning will appear and you will be forced to wait 30 seconds. This is normal and means you are doing everything right so far. After you have waited the 30 Seconds, press 1 (button on your Wiimote). Press continue. Press Install The Homebrew Channel. Press continue and continue. You can exit now and you will have the Homebrew Channel. There is a catch though, if you mess something up in a risky homebrew app, it could mess your Wii up. These are called bricks and they come in many forms. They are not very common if you know what you are doing, but if you want protection from this, KEEP READING. Okay, so if you're still reading you are smart, congrats! The first thing, you need to do is open the Homebrew Channel. After that, press the HOME button on your Wiimote or Start Button if you are using a Gamecube Controller. From here, it will open you to alot of options. Press the BootMii button. BEWARE: you need 512MB of space (which isnt much these days). Now, that you at the BootMii Menu, press the button with the gears/screws. Next, press the button with the green arrow. When its done exit. You are done with Homebrew, but there isnt much you can do with it so far, you just have the app you might wanna install more stuff such as apps to bring back online, so you can play games or even emulators. The possiblities are almost endless, if you wanna learn more about installing Homebrew Apps, you should keep reading on this site </p>
